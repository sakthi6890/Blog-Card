# Blog-Card
This project is a Blog Card that showcases different types of rare mushrooms with an interactive and visually appealing design. The blog card features three slides, each containing an image, title, description, and a "Read more" button.

# Features
## Interactive Slideshow: Users can switch between different mushrooms using radio buttons that act as sliders.
 * Image Toggle: Clicking on the image reveals more details about the selected mushroom.   
  Responsive Design: The layout adjusts based on screen size for a smooth user experience.   
  Minimalist UI: Simple and elegant design using HTML and CSS for easy customization.
## How It Works
 Three radio buttons (tap-1, tap-2, tap-3) allow users to navigate between different mushroom details.
 A checkbox (imgTap) enables an interactive image effect.
 Labels associated with radio inputs act as manual sliders for navigation.
 Each mushroom has an image, a title, a short description, and a call-to-action button.
## Customization
 Replace images (.img-1, .img-2, .img-3) with your own.
 Modify text content to showcase different topics.
 Enhance the UI with CSS animations.

### This project is perfect for blog previews, product showcases, or educational content. ðŸš€
